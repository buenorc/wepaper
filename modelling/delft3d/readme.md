This folder contains all boundary and initial conditions used to run all hypothetical scenarios with the Delft3D-FLOW

* **.enc** is the grid enclosure 
* **.gnd** is the numerical grid used to run all simulations
* **.tem** is the temperature model parameters (heat flux)
* **.ini** is the inital temperature condition file used to run the model
* **.wnd** is the wind-forcing file used to generate the basin-scale internal wave 
* **.dep** is the bathymetry file
* **.eva** is the evaporation and precipitation file


&\sigma; = 


Note that there are 32 files **.ini**, one initial condition for each simulation. Wind-forcing and reservoir shape has been kept constant for all simulations.
