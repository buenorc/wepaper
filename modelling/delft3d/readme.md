This folder contains input data (for Delft3D-FLOW) to run all hypothetical scenarios mentioned in the manuscript 

Types of input data:
* **.enc** is the grid enclosure 
* **.gnd** is the numerical grid
* **.tem** is the temperature model parameters (heat flux)
* **.ini** is the inital temperature condition file used to run the model
* **.wnd** is the wind-forcing file used to generate the basin-scale internal wave 
* **.dep** is the bathymetry file
* **.eva** is the evaporation and precipitation file
